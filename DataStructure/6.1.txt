Natural language understanding based spoken dialog system has been a popular topic in the past years of artificial intelligence renaissance. Many of those influential systems include a question answering module, e.g. Apple’s Siri, IBM’s Watson and Amazon’s Echo. In this paper, we address the Question Answering (QA) module in those spoken QA systems. We treat the QA from a text matching and selection perspective. IBM’s Watson system [1] is a classical example of the traditional way of doing Question Answering (QA). In this work we utilize a deep learning framework to accomplish the answer selection which is a key step in the QA task. Hence QA is studied from an answer matching and selection perspective. Given a question q and an answer candidate pool {a1, a2, ..., as} for that question (s is the pool size), the goal is to find the best answer candidate ak, 1 ≤ k ≤ s . If the selected answer ak is inside the ground truth set (one question could have more than one correct answer) of question q , the question q is considered to be answered correctly, otherwise it is answered incorrectly. From the definition, the QA problem can be regarded as a binary classification problem. For each question, for each answer candidate, it may be appropriate or not. In order to find the best pair, we need a metric to measurethe matching degree of each QA pair so that the QA pair with highest metric value will be chosen.
